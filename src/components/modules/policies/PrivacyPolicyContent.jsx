        Your information is regarded as confidential and therefore will not be divulged to any third
        party, unless if legally required to do so to the appropriate authorities. We will not sell,
        share, or rent your personal information to any third party or use your e-mail address for
        unsolicited mail. Any emails sent by us will only be in connection with the provision of
        agreed services, and you retain sole discretion to seek for discontinuation of such

      <p>
        Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses
        the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose
        your information to other parties, whether they are on our App or other sites throughout the
        Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you
        disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their
        privacy policies. Since we do not control the privacy policies of the third parties, you are
        subject to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

      <p>
        We may host surveys for survey creators for our App who are the owners and users of your
        survey responses. We do not own or sell your responses. Anything you expressly disclose in
        your responses will be disclosed to survey creators. Please contact the survey creator
        directly to better understand how they might share your survey responses.

        Information collected will not be considered as sensitive if it is freely available and
        accessible in the public domain or is furnished under the Right to Information Act, 2005,
        any rules made thereunder or any other law for the time being in force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private
        communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways
        not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting and
        foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government, law enforcement
        agencies or third parties. Therefore, although we use industry-standard practices to protect
        your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally
        identifiable information or private communications would always remain private. We do
        however assure you that any disclosure of your personally identifiable information shall be
        personally intimated to you through an email sent to your provided email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about

          you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement and other
          government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in

        You can review and change the information you submitted except Email ID. An option for
        facilitating such change shall be present on the App and such change shall be facilitated by
        the User. If you change any information, we may or may not keep track of your old
        information. We will not retain in our files information you have requested to remove for
        certain circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our
        terms and conditions. Such prior information shall be completely removed from our databases,
        including stored ‘back up’ systems. If you believe that any information, we are holding on
        to you is incorrect or incomplete, or to remove your profile so that others cannot view it,

        We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We
        employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by

        protect the Personal Information submitted to us and information that we have accessed.
